                <p>One thing I love about Brooklyn is that this little borough is a tiny world. A world filled with different people, stories, relationships, languages, traditions, food, and community! Speaking of community, Brooklyn is where I grew up and learned about what makes a community.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-2">
                <p> It's more than just a place to rest your head or a commute to job. Its someone remembering your name & looking out for you. Its hearing the ice cream truck, telling you it's nice out. It's the excited conversations between neighbors. It's the Bodega that has what you need when you're broke as a joke. It's home.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-3">
                <p>You know the phrase "It takes a Village to raise a child"? Well, Brooklyn is just that and more. This place may be tough on the outside but on the inside, it feels like a nice warm bed after a day in the snow. Or a homecooked meal carefully crafted by your favorite person. And then some.</p>
